This package allows text to be converted to speech using the IBM Watson API.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require pen-y-fan/watson-text-to-speech-php
```

## Usage

### API Key

First obtain an API Key, free from [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/cloud/watson-text-to-speech), the lite
 tier allows 10,000 Characters per Month. No credit card is required. For full instructions see 
 [Getting started with Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-gettingStarted#getting-started-tutorial)

### TL&DR;

Minimum required information to run the package.

```php
use PenYFan\WatsonTextToSpeech\WatsonTextToSpeech;

$watson = new WatsonTextToSpeech();
$watson->setApiKey('yourAPIkeyFromIBM');
$watson->setWatsonUrl('https://api.eu-gb.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com');
$watson->setOutputPath('/public');
$file = $watson->runTextToSpeech('This is the text you want to convert to speech');
```

This will save a **mp3** (default) in the **/public** folder (or the folder you specified). The $file variable will
 confirm the path and filename.

### Detailed explanation

#### Instantiate the project

After installing the package, instantiate `WatsonTextToSpeech` object

```php
use PenYFan\WatsonTextToSpeech\WatsonTextToSpeech;

$watson = new WatsonTextToSpeech();
```

#### Setting API Key

Change to the API key in your Manage Credentials for Text to Speech.
 
- e.g. f5sAznhrKQyvBFFaZbtF60m5tzLbqWhyALQawBg5TjRI

**Note:** this is the example from the tutorial - it will not work!

```php
$apiKey = 'f5sAznhrKQyvBFFaZbtF60m5tzLbqWhyALQawBg5TjRI';

$watson->setApiKey($apiKey);
```

#### Setting Watson Url

Set the Url to the region you selected when you signed up to the Watson API. This example is for London.

```php
$watsonUrl = 'https://api.eu-gb.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com';

$watson->setWatsonUrl($watsonUrl);
```

Available regions:

* Dallas: https://api.us-south.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com
* Washington DC: https://api.us-east.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com
* Frankfurt: https://api.eu-de.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com
* Sydney: https://api.au-syd.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com
* Tokyo: https://api.jp-tok.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com
* London: https://api.eu-gb.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com
* Seoul: https://api.kr-seo.text-to-speech.watson.cloud.ibm.com

#### Setting output path

Set absolute path of the directory where to save the output. You don't need to provide a file name as it will be auto
 generated.

```php
$path = '/aboslute/path/to/directory';

$watson->setOutputPath($path);
```

This will return the absolute path of the file created if text to speech conversion is successful, otherwise will throw
 an Exception.

#### Convert Text to Speech

Pass text to convert to speech.

```php
$text = 'This is some text I want converted to speech';

$file = $watson->runTextToSpeech($text);
```

### Exception handling

Every function throws an Exception in case of any error/issue. Bind the code block within `try-catch` block to catch
 any exception occurred.

_Ex:_

```php
try {
    $watson->setAudioFormat('mp4');
} catch (Exception $exception) {
    echo $exception->getMessage();
}
```

Will throw and exception `Not a valid audio format.` as `mp4` audio format is not
 supported as of now

### Other callable methods

##### Set Audio Format

```php
$watson->setAudioFormat('wav');
```

* _allowed formats:_ `basic`, `flac`, `l16`, `ogg`, `ogg;codecs=opus`, `ogg;codecs=vorbis`, `mp3`, `mpeg`, `mulaw`,

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

PHPUnit is used to run tests, via a composer script. To run the unit tests, From the root of the project run:

```shell script
composer test:unit
```

Unit tests do not perform API calls, the **API_KEY** does not need to be set to run the unit tests.

#### Run all the tests

To run the full test suite, including unit and feature tests, which include calling the IBM Watson API. The **API_KEY**
 needs to be set in tests/**AbstractSecret.php**. For security reasons this file is excluded from Git and Github:

- Rename File: tests/**AbstractSecretExample.php** to tests/**AbstractSecret.php**
- Open the **AbstractSecret.php** file 
- Rename Class: **AbstractSecretExample** to **AbstractSecret**
- Add the API key: 
  - Open <https://cloud.ibm.com/> and sign in.
  - Click Services 
  - Click Text to Speech (under services)
  - under Credentials click Show credentials. The API key will be shown.
  - Copy and paste the key into the constant **API_KEY**
  
```shell script
composer test
```

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac, the same PHPUnit `composer test` can be run

```shell script
pu
```

#### Tests with Coverage Report

To run all test and generate a coverage report run:

```shell script
composer test-coverage
```

The coverage report is created in /builds, it is best viewed by opening **index.html** in your browser.

### Code Standard

Easy Coding Standard (ECS) is used to check for style and code standards, PSR-12 is used.

#### Check Code

To check code, but not fix an errors:

```shell script
composer check-cs
``` 

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac, the same PHPUnit `composer check-cs` can
 be run:

```shell script
cc
```

#### Fix Code

May code fixes are automatically provided by ECS, if advised to run --fix, the following script can be run.

```shell script
composer fix-cs
```

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac, the same PHPUnit `composer fix-cs` can
 be run:

```shell script
fc
```

### Static Analysis

PHPStan is used to run static analysis checks:

```shell script
composer phpstan
```

On Windows a batch file has been created, similar to an alias on Linux/Mac, the same PHPUnit `composer phpstan` can
 be run:

```shell script
ps
```
